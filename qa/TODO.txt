    Automating testing with Grunt

on github still works. The next Idea would be to check the next commit

    small change not important

and see if there is a problem with grunt (i.e with cafe-mocha-modul) or with mocha itself (i.e. 

mocha -u tdd -R spec qa/tests-crosspage.js 2>/dev/null

is giving an error? Maybe then try npm install -g mocha
